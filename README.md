# Chess-Cs200-proj
One of the very first projects! There is a room for a lot of improvements.
I made console-based chess game using Inheritence. The main code for the chess board is in Source.cpp where as each of the chess pieces have their own class.

### Compiling
You can compile and run the game using

```
g++ source.cpp -o game  
game.exe
```

### Game Mechanics
This is how the start screen looks like.

![Start](/Imgs/StartScreen.png)    
You can move the units using the blocks of the board A0, A1 etc
If you try to make an invalid move it will give an error.
